			<p>We call it Big Bang. It shows the explosive development of Twitter since the beginning from its center (birth) with two people to its edges (today) with 75 Million people. Well aware that a big paper thin disc it’s probably going to be a bitch to print and a big pain to put the wall—we are still going to try to print it circle round. Please don’t faint just yet. Here is the logic:</p>
			<p>So now we no longer need little 1px slices in the background-image property, just remember to make sure all the colors in each line of CSS match up, and that you choose a nice flat colour fallback that works with your content. I’m very impressed with how slim the CSS needs to be to get this great cross-browser CSS background gradient. Just saying those words gives me shivers. Yay for CSS!</p>
			<p>One other thing that this allows, which was never possible using css background images, is stretchable gradients. Not only can the content be allowed to expand ‘naturally’ via site updates etc, but we can actually animate gradiented DIVs and preserve the effect!</p>

// Module System
var module = {}
process.compile("(function (exports) {"
               + process.binding("natives").module
               + "\n})", "module")(module);

// TODO: make sure that event module gets loaded here once it's
// factored out of module.js
// module.require("events");

// Signal Handlers

function isSignal (event) {
  return event.slice(0, 3) === 'SIG' && process.hasOwnProperty(event);
};

So if you suggest someone, make sure that you suggest someone else for deletion. (We have some general doubts if there should be any corporations on the list, your opinion on that matter—via Twitter—is very welcome). You can see the shortlist and help us by collaborating on our current spreadsheet on Google docs.
